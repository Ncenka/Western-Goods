		<text>
			An unknown weapon, the firing mechanism of which has not been established. The weapon appears to be out of ammunition - squeezing the trigger doesn't do anything. It's very heavy and definitely high-tech. Of note is that it appears not to fire bullets based on ignition. Most probably, the rounds are propelled by electro-magnetic forces. One can only suspect what kind of destructive potential it possesses.\n
