		<text>Williams "Ashes" Heades is a member of the Mercenaries. Former UN soldier, he was sent to multiple theaters of war as part of UN task forces. He fought the civil war in the 2010 rebellion in Altis, Greece. He was later sent to the Chornobyl exclusion zone as part of a special UNISG deployment. Not a lot is known about what he was tasked with, all that people know is he decided to stay and did not leave with the rest of the deployment.</text>

		<text>Do you just go around and ask random people who they are? Alright, if that's so, I'm Williams Heades, people call me "Ashes". I oversee imports from western countries for Mercenaries. I've been in the Zone for a while now, and business has never been this good.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="western_goods_trader_meet_2">
		<text>So you're the one who imports all those goods into the Zone? I've seen other traders in the Zone with imported goods, do they also import them?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="western_goods_trader_meet_3">
		<text>No, most of them get it through me. It's a real pain to get this many goods into the Zone, but as Mercenaries, we have the necessary resources to get it done.</text>

	<string id="western_goods_trader_meet_5">
		<text>Well you know how we are. If you pay good money, we can always find an agreement. I don't believe in most of the Zone's bullshit anyway. I take no part in these wars faction wage to each others. So long as you're not a total dumbass, we can make business together.</text>
