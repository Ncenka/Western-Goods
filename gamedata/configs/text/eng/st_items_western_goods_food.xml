			Charal is a popular brand in France, that specializes in frozen preparations of minced beef. Some traders around the Zone manage to import some of their products from time to time. This box needs to be prepared for 1 min 50 seconds in a microwave, although it seems this one was recently prepared, so even if it's cold, it's ready to eat.\n
